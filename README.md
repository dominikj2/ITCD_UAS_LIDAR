Figure 5: Example ITD with typical forest conditions using red to represent unclassified low density points, brown-to-green colour scale to represent understorey points,  and all other colours to represent detected trees, where (a) shows intertwining canopy (IC) as well as suppressed (S) and mid-storey (MS) trees, (b) shows leaning trees (L), overstorey canopy base touching understorey (CB) and MS, (c) shows IC, S and MS, (d) shows IC and dead stags (D), (e) shows MS, L and S, and (f-h) shows deteriorating point densities down the vegetation profile (PD) under circumstances with CB, S, D and IC.
